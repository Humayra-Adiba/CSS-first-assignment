# 👋🏻 Hey, there!
## My CSS first project
### This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time when I made a full design of a website
#### I've written many code lines for the 1<sup>st</sup> time & <br />I also had to spend much time that I couldn't imagine. <br />However I am feeling very applause that I made of.
#### I know it's uncomplicated but...
#### I also have a craving to be a smart *delveloper & programmer*
